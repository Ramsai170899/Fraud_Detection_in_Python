# Fraud Detection in Python
Random forest Classifier is used for classifying the fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases in the case of motor insurance.

The target variable(FraudFound) has a high **data imbalance** as it is not often to have a fraudulent claim. to address the that problem, simple minority over sampling technique **(SMOTE)** is used.

Various evaluation metrics are used in model evaluation such as **accuracy score, confusion matrix , precision , recall , f-score , and AUC-ROC curve**.

All the code is documented and explained well.
