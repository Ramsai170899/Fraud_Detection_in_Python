Random forest Classifier is used for classifying the fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases in the case of motor insurance.

the target variable has a high data imbalance as it is not often to have a fraudulent claim. to address the that problem, simple minority over sampling technique(SMOTE) is used.

various evaluation metrics are used in model evaluation such as accuracy score, confusion matrix , precision , recall , f-score , and AUC-ROC curve.

all the code is documented and explained well. 

work might undergo changes in the near future
